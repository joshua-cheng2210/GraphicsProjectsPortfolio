# project 1: TextRainAnimationForSnapchat

webiste to run the program: 
- https://joshua-cheng2210.github.io/TextRainAnimationForSnapchat

language skills developed: 
- typescipt, 

packages uesd:
- gophergfx: specially created graphics library for snmall projects

topics learnt
- learning how 2D coordinate system works

# project 2: MiniGame

webiste to run the program: 
- https://joshua-cheng2210.github.io/MiniGame

language skills developed: 
- typescipt, 

topics learnt
- learn how 3D coordinate system works
- how to compute, create and render geometric shapes
- how to apply textures to the 3D geometric shapes

# project 3: DataVisualization

webiste to run the program: 
- https://joshua-cheng2210.github.io/3DataVisualization

language skills developed: 
- typescipt, 

packages:
- using mocap data (mocap: motion Capture --> its a big files containsa series of coordinates of different points on the object moving as time passes)

topics learnt
- how to compute, create and render geometric shapes
- how to apply textures to the 3D geometric shapes
- how to render between 2D and 3D coordinate planes
- if theres 1 thing to take away, higher graphics rendering detail and graphics computing speed are each others trade-offs

# project 4: 3DObjectAnimation

webiste to run the program: 
- https://joshua-cheng2210.github.io/3DObjectAnimation

language skills developed: 
- typescipt, 

packages:
- using mocap data (mocap: motion Capture --> its a big files containsa series of coordinates of different points on the object moving as time passes)

topics learnt
- building characters or object's components
- handling each component's movements relative to its joints or starting points

# project 5: ObjectTextureRendering

webiste to run the program:
- https://joshua-cheng2210.github.io/ObjectTextureRendering

language skills developed:
- .vert and .vert shaders --> this renders the lighting and texture of of the object surface
  
topics learnt
- rendering lightings from a light source and shadows casted to the perspective or POV of the camera
- rendering surface texture to be looking smooth or rougher

# project 6: MyDrawingBoard

webiste to run the program: 
- https://joshua-cheng2210.github.io/MyDrawingBoard

language skills developed: 
- typescipt, 

package learned: 
- jekyll --> for hosting the project through git hub (i later realized that this is only needed if you don't haven't initialize one yet)

topics learnt
- ray casting
- first person POV camera viewing
- interaction of clicking items on the first person POV screen
